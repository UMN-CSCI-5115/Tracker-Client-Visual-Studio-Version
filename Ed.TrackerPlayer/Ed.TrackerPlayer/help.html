            Tracker
            Mobile
            is an
            Open
            Source
            project
            undertaken
            by edmentum.
            Currently
            it allows
            much
            of the
            viewing
            functionality
            of the
            original
            Tracker
            program
            files
            to be
            achieved
            through
            a web
            browser,
            rather
            than
            through
            a
            stand-alone
            application.
            While
            Tracker
            Mobile
            lacks
            some
            of Tracker’s
            features,
            there
            is a
            lot of
            room
            for program
            expansion.

        <p>
            A track
            is used
            to model
            an element
            that
            changes
            over
            time.
            Tracker
            Mobile
            can currently
            show
            two types
            of tracks.
        </p>
        <h3>Point
            Mass
        </h3>
        <p>
            A point
            mass
            represents
            a zero
            dimensional
            point
            that
            has some
            finite
            mass.
            They
            do not
            exist
            in reality,
            as it
            is not
            possible
            for an
            object
            to have
            mass
            without
            volume.
            However,
            point
            masses
            are the
            building
            blocks
            with
            which
            more
            complex
            and realistic
            models
            of physical
            systems
            are constructed
            in classical
            physics.
        </p>
        <h3>Center
            of Mass
        </h3>
        <p>
            A center
            of mass
            represents
            the center
            of mass
            of a
            collection
            of point
            masses.
            Its mass
            is defined
            as the
            sum of
            the masses
            of the
            points
            to which
            it is
            linked.
            Similarly,
            its steps
            are not
            manually
            marked
            but instead
            are determined
            by the
            positions
            and masses
            of its
            linked
            point
            masses.
            If all
            of the
            linked
            point
            masses
            are equal
            in weight,
            the center
            of mass
            will
            appear
            in the
            exact
            center
            of the
            linked
            masses.
            Otherwise
            the position
            of the
            center
            of mass
            to be
            weighted
            towards
            the point
            masses
            with
            the most
            mass.
